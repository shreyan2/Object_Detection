# Object_Detection
Here I have used a Yolo architecture to perform real time video object detection.
## Model:
The model used has been pre-trained on MS COCO dataset. The config file and labels for the dataset are uploaded in the Yolo Folder.
## Sample output:
I have tested the model with a highway traffic footage and the output is also uploaded.
